# Junior Frontend Developer

## Task

Write a simple "widget" that uses JavaScript to request data from an external weather API,
and visualize it inside the Browser. Do NOT use a framework or library for this!

### Requirements

1. Get the location of the user
2. Get the weather data for the location of the user
3. Write a "widget" that is showing the following information
   * Weather Location
   * current temperature
   * current cloudiness with an svg-icon representing this information (sun, sun & clouds, rain and so on)
   * current wind

You don't have to take too much care about cross-browser testing. If its working in
the latest versions of chrome and firefox everything is fine :)

## Questions

* How could you request data inside the browser, from another domain?
* What does CORS stand for?
* Please name 5 different HTTP methods and explain what they are used for.
* What is the difference between 'DOMContentLoaded' and 'Load' events?
* What is the DOM?
